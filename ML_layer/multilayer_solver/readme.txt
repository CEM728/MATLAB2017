The “multilayer_solver.m” is the main file. MPSpack from https://code.google.com/p/mpspack/ is required. Simply typing “multilayer_solver” without quotation symbol in MATLAB command window will run a default case (100 interfaces consisting of sine, triangle, and rectangle interfaces). It will compute the similar case as in Figure 4 in Optics Express paper.

More instruction will be added in “readme.txt” file
